# Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my first steps and progress in the Cybersecurity field.  
I started by building a strong foundation through the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate**, which covers essential IT concepts including hardware, operating systems, networking, troubleshooting, and security fundamentals.

My goal is to develop the technical depth required to transition into a cybersecurity role, beginning with IT support and evolving toward security operations and incident response.

## Reflection

The Google IT Support program helped me understand how systems, networks, and users connect — which is the foundation of cybersecurity.  
Every alert, incident, or vulnerability begins as a technical issue, and understanding these fundamentals is what allows an analyst to respond effectively.
